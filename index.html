  <h1>Welcome to PyData PDX!</h1>

  <h2>About the Community</h2>

    <p>
      The monthly meetups and annual conferences are put together by a group of volunteers organizers passionate about Python.
      Since 2019, we have provided Pythonistas in Portland a forum to learn from each other on the use of Python in the ever-evolving fields of data management, processing, analytics and visualisation.
      PyData PDX meetups (usually) take place on the first Tuesday of each month.
