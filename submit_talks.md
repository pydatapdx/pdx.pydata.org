# Speaking at PyData PDX Meetups
Have you been working on an interesting project that you want to show off?
Found a really cool library that you want everyone to know about?
Get in touch and let’s get you on the stage!

Fill out the [Submit a Talk Form](https://forms.gle/X9CFyZVDD76A3GZ68)
and one of the organizers will get back to you ASAP.

There’s a few details to note:

Each meetup will have two longer talks &mdash; 30 minutes talk time (including any Q&A)
 * There is time for two or three 5 minute lightning talks
 * Check the NumFOCUS [Code of Conduct](https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct) &mdash; all language and imagery must be inclusive (e.g. prefer something like ‘folks’ over ‘guys’)
 * No product pitches &mdash; we’re strict about this &mdash; these aren’t sales slots and the room is not populated by buyers 
 * Your talk should educate, but you’re welcome to note "we’re hiring" or similar during your talk
