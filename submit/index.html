  <h1>Speaking at PyData PDX Meetups</h1>

  <p>
    Have you been working on an interesting project that you want to show off?
    Found a really cool library that you want everyone to know about?
    Get in touch and let’s get you on the stage!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Fill out the <a href="https://forms.gle/X9CFyZVDD76A3GZ68">SUBMIT A TALK FORM</a> 
    and one of the organizers will get back to you ASAP.

  <p>
    There’s a few details to note:

    <ul>
      <li>Each meetup will have two longer talks &mdash; 30 minutes talk time (including any Q&A)</li>
      <li>There is time for two or three 5 minute lightning talks</li>
      <li>Check the NumFOCUS <a href="https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a> &mdash; all language and imagery must be inclusive (e.g. prefer something like ‘folks’ over ‘guys’)</li>
      <li>No product pitches &mdash; we’re strict about this &mdash; these aren’t sales slots and the room is not populated by buyers</li>
      <li>Your talk should educate, but you’re welcome to note "we’re hiring" or similar during your talk</li>
    </ul>
